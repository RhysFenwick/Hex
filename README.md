## Hex

This started as a learning exercise for Java and has morphed into a crude game engine. Maths based off Amit Patel's [hexagonal grid reference guide](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/).

## Global TODO

### Behind the scenes
- "Chunk" graphics to better handle large (but mostly static) grids

### Game
- Level save functionality (doubles as level editor)
- Placeable units beyond walls
- Projectile logic (interpolated line) + projectiles
